# README

The goal of this coding challenge is to write an algorithm that checks the availability of an agenda depending on the events attached to it. The main method has a start date for input and is looking for the availability of the next 7 days.

There are two kinds of events:

- ‘opening’, are the openings for a specific day and they can be recurring week by week.
- ‘appointment’, times that are already booked.

The main files to look at are **app/models/event.rb** and **test/models/event_test.rb**.
